# Overview

In this software, I was trying to recreate the classic arcade game Space Invaders. To do this, I needed to program a "tank" for the player to move and shoot at "invaders" that slowly descend down the screen. At the bottom of the screen I needed eight "buildings" that disappear when hit with tank bullets or invaders. The game is won if all the invaders are killed and the game is lost if all the buildings are destroyed.;

I wrote this software to expand my knowledge of Python, particularly in working with classes in the program. I also used this opportunity to learn about the Arcade library within Python that provides tools specifically for game design.

# Development Environment

To write this code I used my laptop with a Windows 11 OS. The environment I used was Visual Code Studio.

I wrote this program in the Python language and used the Arcade library made for video game design.

# Future Work

* I want to create levels of increasing difficulty that players can go through.
* I want to add the ability for a player to save their progress so they can come back to the game later.
* I want to give the Invaders the ability to shoot back.
